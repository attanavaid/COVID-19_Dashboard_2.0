                <i>Who Are We?</i>
              </h2>
              <p>
                We are a team of students that wanted to make COVID-19 data
                easily accessible by county population.
                <br />
                We created this application, because we were determined to
                improve the way data is shown to us. Our determination started
                at the beginning of September 2021. Since then, we have been
                working hard to create something innovating and effective in a
                short span of time. We envisioned a future where there are no
                obstacles that prevent people from looking up COVID-19 for
                counties.
                <br />
                Thanks to the hard work of our team, weâ€™ve managed to
                successfully create a wonderful project with a simplistic web
                interface that supports all devices.

                This application was designed by UMBC students. So the first few
                users of this application are all from UMBC. And they mainly
                viewed COVID-19 data of Baltimore County. This county was also
                used as the basis for development.
                <br />
                From all the support and encouragement we received at UMBC, we
                decided to reach further and bring the support and care we
                received from the community of UMBC, to more people. As our
                community expands, more and more patients get the care and
                management they really deserve and need to improve their health.
